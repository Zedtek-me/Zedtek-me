Hello friend, welcome to my github profile.
As you may have noticed, my full name is Zechariah Adebayo.
I am a passionate software developer, and an intuitive type, for the matter. Hence, I love to burrow into the core
of several concepts, with the aim of demystifying the concepts, thereby gaining thorough understanding of such concepts
and how to properly approach related problems.

By the way, if anything, I am open for project collaborations.
That's all for now; have a nice time exploring my repos!
